# AdvancesInFinancialMachineLearning

This repository is for the exercises on Advances In Financial Machine Learning. 

In this repository I use S&P future 500 ticks instead of the data mentioned in the book, so there may be small differences. The data is uploaded but you can download it through https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/finnhub/sp-500-futures-tick-data-sp.
